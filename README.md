# Touchless_light_switch
The Touchless Light Switch project transforms your Raspberry Pi into a touchless lighting control system, allowing users to manage lights with simple hand gestures. This repository includes the necessary code and instructions to set up a touchless light switch using IR sensors and a Raspberry Pi.


## Components
Hardware Setup
Raspberry Pi Setup:

Connect the Raspberry Pi to the power source.
Ensure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet.
Install required libraries and dependencies.
IR Sensor Setup:

Connect two IR sensors to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Adjust sensor positions for optimal gesture detection.
Power Supply:

Connect the necessary power supply to the Raspberry Pi.
Lighting Connection:

Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the lighting system for control.
Code Structure
The main code is provided in App.py, which includes the following:

Initialization of GPIO pins for IR sensors and lighting control.
Logic to detect hand gestures using IR sensors.
Logic to control lighting based on detected gestures.
